Dynamic Programming:
- like divide and conquer method: solve problems bu combining the solutions to SUBPROBLEMS
Programming in this context refers to a tabular method
- apply when subproblems Overlap - subproblems share subsubProblems
- by having an array to STORE the answer of the Subproblems
- typically apply to OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS

How to develop a dynamic programming algorithm:
1. Characterise the structure of an optimal solution
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a BOTTON-UP fashion
4. COnstruct an Optimal solution from computed information
