Recursion: the process in which a function CALL ITSELF directly or indirectly
=> corresponding function is called a RECUSRIVE function
=> solving smaller subproblems of the original problem

Properties:
	- performing the SAME operations multiple times with DIFFERENT inputs
	- in every step, we try smaller inputs to make the problem SMALLER
	- BASE CONDITION is needed to STOP the recursion

IT MUST HAVE BASE CASE AND INDUCTION
